# Kamailio SIP Server with Python Backend Integration

### Introduction
This project deploys the Kamailio SIP Server configured to work alongside a Python-based backend server. Kamailio is an open-source SIP server known for its robustness, scalability, and extensive customization capabilities, making it ideal for handling thousands of call setups per second. The Python server is used to manage certain backend functionalities such as dynamic routing, user authentication, and real-time data processing.

### Features
- **SIP Protocol Management**: Utilizes Kamailio for efficient SIP message handling, user registrations, call routing, and authentication.
- **Dynamic Call Routing**: Implements logic in Python to dynamically route calls based on database lookups, time of day, and other custom criteria.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: The Python backend processes real-time call data for analytics and monitoring purposes.
- **API Integration**: Provides an interface between Kamailio and external systems via a Python API, facilitating actions like dynamic configuration updates, system monitoring, and triggering alerts.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Kamailio SIP Server (Version 5.x or later)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Additional Python libraries: Flask, Requests (Install via pip)
- A suitable database system (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for storing SIP data

### Installation
1. **Install Kamailio**:
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system from the [official Kamailio guide](https://www.kamailio.org/w/documentation/).
   - Configure Kamailio by editing the `kamailio.cfg` file to suit your deployment needs.

2. **Set Up Python Server**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/kamailio-python-server.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory and install required Python packages:
     ```
     cd kamailio-python-server
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Configuration
- **Kamailio Configuration**:
  - Update `kamailio.cfg` to integrate with your Python backend. This might involve setting the dispatching logic to the Python server for decision-making processes.
- **Python Server Configuration**:
  - Configure `app.py` with the correct database connections and any external APIs.

### Running the Servers
- **Start Kamailio Server**:
```
 kamailio -DD -E -f /path/to/your/kamailio.cfg
 python app.py
```

### Usage
Once both servers are running, the system will handle SIP requests as configured. The Python backend can be accessed through its RESTful API at `http://localhost:5000/api` for monitoring and management tasks.
